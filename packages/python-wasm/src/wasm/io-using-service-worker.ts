fixServiceWorker:

There is exactly one situation where I know this is definitely needed, though
browsers I think could revoke the service worker at any time, so it is good to
have an automated way to fix this. Also, this may be useful if we upgrade the
service worker and add a new URL endpoint, since this will get triggered.

1. Open python-wasm using a service worker on an iphone or ipad in safari.

2. Maybe open another page so the python-wasm page is in the background.
(Probably not needed.)

3. Suspend your phone and wait 1 minute.

4. Turn phone back on. The service worker *might* be completely broken and no
amount of refreshing fixes it. Without the workaround below, the only option is
for the user to clear all private data associated with the site, or wait a while
(maybe an hour) and things maybe start to work again.

I think this is caused by the page suspending in the middle of a "get stdin"
call. This code below does seem to effectively work around the problem, at the
expense of a page refresh when you return to the page. This isn't uncommon on
safari anyways though, since it often dumps pages to save memory.

This doesn't seem to happen on any desktop browsers (including safari) as far
as I can tell, even when suspending/resuming a laptop.

There may be a better fix involving changing how the service worker behaves,
but that is for another commit, and another day.
