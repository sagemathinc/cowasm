"""
This tiny simple custom importer makes it so we can if you have a
tarball foo.tar.xz somewhere in your sys.path that contains a Python
module, then this works:

    import foo

This even works with .so extension module code. It's reasonably
efficient too, in some ways.  How is this possible?  This works in a
very different way than Python's own zipfile importer and to me it
is both much simpler and much better.  At
   https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#pyzipfile-objects
there are docs about turning a Python module (without extension code)
into a zip file which can then be exported.   It works for that
application, but has drawbacks because zip files are much larger than
.tar.xz files; also, it seems like importing is a bit slower.  What
we do here instead is much simpler -- we just automaticlaly extract
the .tar.xz file to a temporary folder, which we add to sys.path.
That's it!  It's ridiculously simple, but works well for our application
to WebAssembly where small size is very important.

- When working on this, here's how to update things after a change:

~/cowasm/packages/cpython$  rm dist/wasm/.install-data && cp src/cowasm_importer.py dist/wasm/lib/python3.11/site-packages/ && make && cd ../python-wasm/ && make && cd ../cpython/
