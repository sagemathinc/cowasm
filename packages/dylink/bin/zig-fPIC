# Use this to build -fPIC C or C++ code using zig.   I like doing this, since zig is a very
# compact and efficient way to CLANG/LLVM.  Unfortunately (in mid 2022), zig doesn't directly
# support building -fPIC code (the flag does nothing), which is of course absolutely required
# to create and use a dynamic library with WebAssembly.   Fortunately, zig includes wasm-ld
# and clang, so we can work around this shortcoming.  This script does so, basically by
# add a bunch of obscure options to the command line.

# TODO: upstream this by improving the way zig handles -target=wasm32-emscripten, or
# some other approach.
