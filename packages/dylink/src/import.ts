/*
** Our approach to the stack **

It took me a long time to understand __stack_pointer in WASM and with dynamic
linking, since no docs really explained it and I sort of hit a wall with the
emscripten sources, since the relevant code appears to be in assembly, and
anyway I have to operate in the constraints of what zig provides. The way I
understood __stack_pointer is by creating a bunch of sample programs and study
the output of wasm-decompile and wasm2wat.   First some remarks:

- the stack size for the main executable is controlled at compile time by zig.
It's by default 1MB when you use "zig build-exe", but it's only 64KB
when you use "zig build-lib".   This difference is probably a bug, but a
rememedy is type include "--stack 1048576 " in the command line. Also, I know
of no way to create a WebAssembly.Global that is the main __stack_pointer.
Maybe emscripten does via assmebly code, but I can't tell.

- The stack grows *DOWN*, i.e., if the stack is 1MB then __stack_pointer
gets set by default to 1048576 (= 1MB), and at the beginning of each
function, the VM grabs the current stack pointer, then substracts off
how much space will be needed for running that function, then starts
working with that (so it can go up), and then resets it to where it was.

- Since I have no idea how to get the current __stack_pointer for ther main
module, here we allocate a new chunk of memory on the heap for each dynamic
library to use as its own stack. We then pass in __stack_pointer as a value
at the very end of that memory.   The __stack_pointer's in each dynamic
library and in the module are just completely different variables in different
WASM instances that are all using the same shared memory.  Everybody has
their own stacks and they don't overlap with each other at all. This
seems to work well, given our constaints, and hopefully doesn't waste too
much memory.

NOTE: There arguments about what stack size to use here -- it's still 5MB in
emscripten today, and in zig it is 1MB:
 - https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/pull/10019
 - https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/3735 <-- this did get fixed upstream!
*/

// Stack size for imported dynamic libraries -- we use 1MB. This is
// a runtime parameter.
const STACK_SIZE = 1048576; // 1MB;  to use 64KB it would be 65536.
