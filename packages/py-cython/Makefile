# This is NOT the cython test suite, which is difficult to run due to using threads
# and probably doesn't work.  But we at least test something, which is building and
# running some of the demos.

# We touch numpy.py below is a little hack to disable the numpy test.
# That test fails since there's a bunch
# we need to do regarding disabling setjmp, etc., to get this stuff to build.
